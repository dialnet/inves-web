          INV.ES emerges within the framework of the Recovery, Transformation,
          and Resilience Plan, through the UniDigital program, promoted by the
          Ministry of Universities to advance the modernization and
          digitalization of the Spanish university system.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project is developed under Royal Decree 641/2021, which regulates
          the direct granting of subsidies to Spanish public universities for
          investment in digital infrastructures, technological developments, and
          collaborative inter-university projects of general interest to the
          university system.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this context, the University of La Rioja, as coordinating
          university, presented in November 2021 the proposal for the
          inter-university project Collective Research Portal of Spanish
          Universities (INV.ES). The project was conceived from its inception as
          a collaborative initiative, aligned with the objectives of UniDigital
          and oriented towards generating a shared, reusable, and sustainable
          solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          The technical management and development of the project have been
          undertaken by the Dialnet Foundation, which has made the Dialnet CRIS
          technology available to INV.ES, a consolidated infrastructure widely
          implemented in the university sector, guaranteeing interoperability,
          scalability, and utilization of the portal by the entire Spanish
          university system.

          INV.ES is conceived from its origin as an infrastructure aligned with
          the principles of open science, understood as a model that promotes
          transparency, free access to scientific knowledge, and the reuse of
          research results to maximize their social, academic, and economic
          impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          The portal facilitates unified access to the scientific production of
          Spanish public universities, prominently incorporating results
          available in open access and favoring their visibility and
          dissemination through a single consultation point. In this way, INV.ES
          contributes to reducing barriers to access to scientific information
          and to strengthening the role of universities as generators and
          transmitters of open knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, INV.ES promotes interoperability and reuse of scientific
          information, through the standardization of data from multiple
          institutions and the adoption of common information models. This
          approach facilitates the exploitation of data by researchers,
          universities, institutional leaders, and other agents of the science,
          technology, and innovation system.
        </p>
        <p>
          The portal also incorporates analysis and visualization tools that
          allow contextualizing research activity, identifying collaboration
          networks, and analyzing trends, contributing to greater transparency
          in the evaluation and monitoring of university research.
        </p>
        <p>
          In line with international commitments on open science, INV.ES offers
          an aggregated presentation of scientific production linked to the
          Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), highlighting the contribution of
          Spanish universities to major social, economic, and environmental
          challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this approach, INV.ES establishes itself as a strategic
          infrastructure for advancing towards a more open, accessible,
          collaborative, and impact-oriented research ecosystem, strengthening
          knowledge transfer and the social return on public investment in
          research.

    <ContentCard padding="large">
      <div class="text-lg leading-relaxed space-y-4">
        <p>
          The development of INV.ES has involved addressing a series of
          strategic, technological, and organizational challenges, derived both
          from its inter-university character and from its vocation to serve the
          entire Spanish university system.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the main challenges is the integration of information from
          multiple universities, each with its own systems, organizational
          structures, and data models. To this end, INV.ES has worked on
          defining a shared common language, capable of harmonizing and
          standardizing scientific information, ensuring its coherence, quality,
          and comparability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Associated with this, the project addresses the challenge of data
          deduplication and consolidation, especially regarding publications,
          authors, research groups, and institutional affiliations. The correct
          identification of researchers and results is key to offering reliable
          information and enabling advanced and reusable analyses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another relevant challenge is the development of a scalable and
          sustainable technological infrastructure, capable of growing
          progressively in number of institutions, data volume, and
          functionalities, without depending on proprietary solutions or
          limiting its adoption by new universities. INV.ES responds to this
          challenge by relying on consolidated technology such as Dialnet CRIS
          and a collaborative model of continuous evolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          INV.ES also faces the challenge of balancing the informative function
          with the management function, offering a portal that not only serves
          as a showcase for university research, but can also be integrated into
          the internal processes of universities and support data-driven
          decision-making.
        </p>
        <p>
          Likewise, the project faces the challenge of effectively promoting
          open science, incorporating open data sources, highlighting production
          in open access, and facilitating the reuse of information, while
          respecting the regulatory frameworks and institutional policies of
          each university.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, INV.ES addresses the challenge of long-term governance and
          sustainability, establishing a shared model among participating
          universities that guarantees the evolution of the portal, its
          maintenance, and its adaptation to new needs of the university system
          and the research ecosystem.
