          The INV.es project has a multi-level governance model designed to
          guarantee coordinated, transparent decision-making aligned with
          national science and research policies. This model allows combining
          institutional strategic vision with efficient technical and
          operational management, relying on the accumulated experience of the
          Dialnet Foundation and the active collaboration of participating
          universities.

      The governance of INV.es is structured in different complementary levels,
      each with clearly defined responsibilities, which allow addressing both
      strategic decisions of national scope as well as operational management
      and technological evolution of the portal.
